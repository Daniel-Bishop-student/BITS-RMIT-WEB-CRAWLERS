    # Dialogue for scene3a

    slim happy "Brenner-456 used to be warm, bright and full of life. There was plenty of food, happiness and community spirit. Kids ran free in the fields without worry and people worked together to build, teach and enjoy life."

    slim excited "The people would gather on the seventh day and pay tribute to the Ora"

    benji surprised "What's the Ora?"

    slim proud "The Ora is the Great Mountain, it is the life source and in return for our loyalty the Ora provides us with kia, a precious earth gem which holds great power."

    harry confused "What kind of power?"

    slim proud "Great powers of healing and growth. It fertilises our soil and purifies our water and regulates our seasons and much more. ” (Slim) continues: “One day a cloud descended upon Brenner. This cloud bore fire and the noise of thunder only much louder. Soldiers descended from the cloud as an endless waterfall. The soldiers ran through the Ora attacking the protectors"

    penny surprised "The Protectors?"

    slim excited "Those assigned the task of protecting the Ora and maintaining the rate of kia extraction. The Ora is generous but too much kia extraction forces an imbalance in our eco-system and makes soil acidic so nothing will grow, our water turns to sludge and becomes infected with bacteria, the sky turns the color of blood as you see above you and the air a dusty barely breathable haze."

    harry confused "How did this happen?"
