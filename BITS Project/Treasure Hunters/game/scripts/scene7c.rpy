    # Dialogue for ending scenario 3

    "The Amazon rebellion shows up last minute and helps them escape and all return to their headquarters."


    harry "There that thick scrub, run we’ll be able to hide in there!"

    "All the kids and Slim run into the scrub"


    soldier "Find them!"


    "Kids huddled together behind a giant bolder" 
    benji "It’s no use Harry, they’ll find us eventually maybe if we turn ourselves in they’ll spare our lives"


    slim "They spare no one"


    penny "Well if we’re going out, let’s go out fighting.  Who’s with me?"


    "Just then a ship floats overhead and shoots a beam down and scoops Harry and the kids up in it."


    #Aboard the ship
    slim "It’s ok these people are the Amazon rebellion, an alliance formed from the few that survived the initial invasion"


    xeena "Welcome warriors, any enemy of killsalot is a friend of ours.  Rest up we have a long journey ahead of us"


    penny "But where are we going? How many of you are there? Why..."


    xeena "All in good time my dear, all in good time..."
