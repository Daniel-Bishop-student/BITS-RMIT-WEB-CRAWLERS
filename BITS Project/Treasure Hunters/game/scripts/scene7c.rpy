    soldier "Yes Master!"

    group "Kids huddled together behind a giant bolder" 

    benji "It’s no use Harry, they’ll find us eventually maybe if we turn ourselves in they’ll spare our lives"

    slim "They spare no one"

    penny "Well if we’re going out, let’s go out fighting.  Who’s with me?"
