    slim "Our water turns to sludge and becomes infected with bacteria, the sky turns the color of blood as you see above you and the air a dusty, barely breathable haze."

    harry "How did this happen?"

    slim "After most of the protectors were killed, the soldiers started extracting the Kia from the mountain at a rate that could not be sustained."

    slim proud "The surviving Protectors are still fighting here in the Rebellion today"

    benji surprised "Why did these soldiers want the Kia?"

    slim mad "(Sighs) The Kia is very powerful but when in the wrong hands can have its power used for terrible things."

    harry mad "Like What?"

    slim "To make high powered weapons, hyper drives and to unlease other untold horrors!"
